            <b>Lorem Ipsum</b> is <strong>simply</strong> dummy 
            text of the printing and typesetting 
           industry. <i>Lorem Ipsum </i>has been the industry's 
           standard <em>dummy text ever</em> since the 1500s, 
           when an <small>unknown printer</small> took a galley of type 
           and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.
           <br><br>
           <mark>It has survived not only</mark> five centuries, 
           but also <del>the leap</del>into electronic typesetting, 
           remaining <ins>essentially</ins> unchanged. 
           It was popularised in the 1960s with the release 
           of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more 
           recently with desktop
